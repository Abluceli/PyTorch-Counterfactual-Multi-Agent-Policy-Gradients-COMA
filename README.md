# PyTorch-Counterfactual-Multi-Agent-Policy-Gradients-COMA
This is PyTorch implementation of paper

Foerster, Jakob N., et al. "Counterfactual multi-agent policy gradients." Thirty-Second AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence. 2018.

in the multiagent environment "findgoals"

The discription of environment is in 'FindGoals.pdf'

you have to install opencv-python and pytorch to run the code. run 'COMA2.py'
you will get the training curve like
